Welcome to this API:

It was created by Robert Thompson during his time at Alchemy code lab. Here's how it works:

The API is still very basic, but it does have some things that you can do. If you make a basic get to the '/' path will return "Hello". 

There is also a Birthday path that a user can follow. If you send a get to 'happy-birthday/(your-name)' and the API will return a happy birthday declaration. If you make a 'custom' query and include your own phrase, the API will include that back in your birthday wishes the API sends back.
